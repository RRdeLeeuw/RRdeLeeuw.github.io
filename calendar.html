<section id="calendar">
  <p>
    This is a calendar application. Intended to mimic some of the functionality
    of other fully featured calender applications online. It renders using
    Javascript and a month and year can be selected. When clicking on a date a
    window will popup via which a calendar event can be added. However, this
    application was designed to use a database. Adding an event is a
    functionality that I have not yet changed to work on this static page. This
    implementation of the calendar makes us of the
    <a href="https://moment.github.io/luxon/">Luxon</a> library.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>This calendar is not fully functional.</b> The full functionality for
    this calendar (adding an item, changing an item, the items rendering in the
    calendar etc.) a database must be connected to store user login data and
    calendar event data. A demonstration of this functionality will be added
    later. Therefore the events listed in the calendar are for demonstration
    only, they are added in reference to today's date.
