  <h2>Todo-list</h2>
  <p>
    This To-Do list was done in a Django webapp, it requires a server side API
    and database to fully function. The todo-list below roughly functions the
    same, however no database is connected. Todo's are therefore not stored
    server side. A refresh will erase all todo's. At the moment it is purely a
    demo of the Javascript functionality and CSS styling.
