    <h2>Credits</h2>
    <p> Please note that there are elements on this webpage for which I do not take credit. Below I will specify
        I few
        elements or styles that I did not create or fully created myself. </p>

    <p>The Lion icon in the upper right corner is created by a creator on <a
            href="https://www.flaticon.com">Flaticon.com</a>.
    <div>Icons made by <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik" title="Freepik">Freepik</a> from <a
            href="https://www.flaticon.com/" title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a></div>
    </p>
    <p> Also, for the calendar on this page I made use of the <a
            href="https://moment.github.io/luxon/">Luxon</a>
        datetime library. This is an extremely useful open
        source Javascript library, on which more info can be found <a
            href="https://moment.github.io/luxon/">here.</a>
    </p>
    <p> The fonts used are Roboto and Ubuntu, both are free fonts available on <a
            href="http://fonts.google.com/">Google
            fonts</a>.</p>
    <p>
        Lastly an honerable mention to Colt Steele, his Udemy courses are awesome. The style for the name in the
        top
        left of the header is totally from his course.
